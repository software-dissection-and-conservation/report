The abstract syntax tree consist mainly of two types of nodes, values and declarations. Value nodes hold values. There are three types of values: strings, identifiers, and regular expressions. String literals are stored by \textit{String} nodes. references to other tokens and rules are stored by \textit{Identifier} nodes. Literals for regular expressions are stored in \textit{RegularExpression} nodes.\par
There are three different types of declaration nodes: \textit{Token}, \textit{Rule} and \textit{Start}. Token nodes hold token declarations, i.e. assign a name to a string literal or regular expression. Rule nodes store data about a rule declaration, i.e. the name of the rule and its productions. Start nodes holds information about which rule to start parsing from.

The root of the abstract syntax tree is the \textit{Grammar} node. It stores all the declarations of a grammar as well as comments. Comments are stored by \textit{Comment} nodes.




This is the parent for all nodes in the abstract syntax tree. It redefines the equality operators $==$ and $!=$ in order to allow nodes to be compared stucturally.
