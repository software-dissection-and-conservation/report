While we have accomplished alot of what set out to do with this project, we still have a few features that we did not manage to complete in time.\par
One of the things we included in our project proposal was to be able to specify a regular expression in the grammar file, our implementation of this feature is incomplete due to the complexity involved in parsing a regular expression that is valid in Python. There are many corner cases that needs to be handled and we felt that the time we would have to spend on that could be spent on more important parts as this is not really a core feature anyway.\par
There are also some features that we did not state in our proposal, but that we would have liked to add if we had more time. The first one being able to specify actions to take place when a production is parsed.\par
We would also like to relax the contraints on the grammar. Right now we have put a limitation on the grammar forcing it be left factored and not have any left factoring. We would have liked to implement an algorithm that accepts a grammar without these limitations and transform it into something that is easy to work with.
