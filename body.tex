\section{Section Title}

The important thing to remember is that all documents that you hand in are drafts towards the final report. The final report should contain

\begin{itemize}
    \item A description of your chosen library.
    \item External tests demonstrating the behaviour of the library (black box testing).
    \item Proposed changes or additions and their motivation
    \item Implementation of proposed changes and test cases. The test cases should be both black box on the behaviour of the implementation and white box providing some code coverage.
\end{itemize}

In your final document all tests should come with some motivation of why you
have the test and what you are trying to test.

Deadlines and deliverables.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A meeting with your lab assistant (me or Anke) in week 49 (next week)
    \item A draft document providing some external tests. This should be done before  you have a meeting in week 49.
    \item A presentation Dec. 9th. Where you will present your proposed changes.
    \item A draft document with your proposed changes.
    \item Dec. 21/2 is the deadline for the final report. By this time all your changes must be implemented, all test cases must be documented.
\end{itemize}
It is important to know that you can hand in a draft report at any
time to get feedback.
