% \section{Task specification}

% The important thing to remember is that all documents that you hand in are drafts towards the final report. The final report should contain

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item A description of your chosen library.
%     \item External tests demonstrating the behaviour of the library (black box testing).
%     \item Proposed changes or additions and their motivation
%     \item Implementation of proposed changes and test cases. The test cases should be both black box on the behaviour of the implementation and white box providing some code coverage.
% \end{itemize}

% In your final document all tests should come with some motivation of why you
% have the test and what you are trying to test.

% Deadlines and deliverables.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item A meeting with your lab assistant (me or Anke) in week 49 (next week)
%     \item A draft document providing some external tests. This should be done before  you have a meeting in week 49.
%     \item A presentation Dec. 9th. Where you will present your proposed changes.
%     \item A draft document with your proposed changes.
%     \item Dec. 21/2 is the deadline for the final report. By this time all your changes must be implemented, all test cases must be documented.
% \end{itemize}
% It is important to know that you can hand in a draft report at any
% time to get feedback.
