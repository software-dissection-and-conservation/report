Parsec is a parser combinator library for Python heavily inspired by the Haskell library with the same name. It is capable of creating parsers for context-sensitive grammars that require infinite lookahead. The library provide some trivial parsers (e.g. parsing a single letter, digit or a string etc.), but the real power of the library is the parser combinators it provides. A parser combinator is a higher order function, which take a number of parsers as input and produce a new parser as output (i.e. it creates a new parser by combining existing parsers). Parsers created by combinator functions can further be used to create new parsers. This technique makes it easy to construct powerful, modular and well-structured parsers that are easy to test. Parsec make good use of Pythons support for operator overloading to make it easy to construct parsers in a concise and readable way.
